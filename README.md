Interview "work simulation"

This exercise is designed to tell us something about your capabilities as a Java developer.
The ultimate goal of it is spelled out in the main method of src/com/proquest/interview/phonebook/PhoneBookImpl.
You will also need to know how to write a few very simple SQL queries.

The code is entirely self-contained: you should be able to load it up in Eclipse or another IDE 
and begin working immediately, without needing any other tools or libraries.

Implement the TODO comments to the best of your ability.  In addition, you should be looking 
at how to improve this program.  The DatabaseUtil class does not need to be changed, 
although you may do so if it seems like an improvement, as long as you do not destroy its functionality.

You should be able to pull this project, make a branch with your changes, and send a pull request along with your resume. 
If you have difficulty, you can download, change the files and send us a zip (not preferred).

This exercise typically takes less than an hour, unless you choose to do significant refactoring.
There are many possible approaches, and no single "right answer".  But do be prepared to discuss 
the changes that you made.

Thank you!
